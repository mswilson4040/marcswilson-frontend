            As a Front End Developer at BluLink Solutions, I worked with a team of project managers
            and designers to help understand customer requirements and build out custom solutions and
            applications. While building these applications, I would primarily work with JavaScript,
            HTML and CSS using libraries/frameworks such as AngularJS, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

            As a Software Developer at Winshuttle, I worked on two separate products that were
            shipped to large enterprise organizations that helped automate processes that drove
            day to day business operations. In addition to development efforts, I also worked with
            external customers to help understand use cases, train and mentor as well as go on site
            (internationally and nationally) to help troubleshoot issues/develop custom solutions.
