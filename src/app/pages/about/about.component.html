          <h3>Life</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I grew up in Lawrence, Kansas and moved to Seattle, Washington in 2012. Somewhere  in between there,
            I served in the United States Marine Corps with two overseas deployments, pursued my childhood dream of becoming a
            Software Developer and traveled to roughly 9 different Countries. I'm a huge Seahawks and Mariners fan
            and enjoy snowboarding, hiking, golf, city life, and writing code.

          <h3>Career</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have primarily worked with external customers to build custom
            applications and software. I have traveled nationally, and internationally, to deliver
            presentations and training, consulting, support and custom development. I started my
            career at an analyst level providing military knowledge to government projects and
            progressed into a rare breed in the workforce of a developer who loves customers,
            documentation and coding.

          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I do many things. First and foremost, I love developing and building things. I
            have taken a high interest in working with the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node)
            and other modern front-end technologies. I spend a lot of my free time freelancing or working on
            side projects such as this website. When I'm not having fun writing code and learning new things, you
            can find me at a Seattle Mariners game, wondering around downtown Seattle taking in all it's offerings,
            or taking my dog (Rylee) on adventures.
